# What is Generative AI?

**Generative AI** is a type of artificial intelligence that can create **new content** ‚Äî like text, images, music, or code ‚Äî based on patterns it learned from **existing data**.

Think of it like this:
- You give it a **prompt** (a question or instruction).
- It analyzes tons of examples it's seen before.
- It produces something **new** that matches what you asked for.

**Example:**
"Write a friendly email to reschedule my meeting."
‚Üí ChatGPT writes a polite message for you.

# How Does It Work?

::: left

**Training**

AI models are trained on massive datasets (books, websites, code, images) to learn patterns, grammar, facts, and styles.

**Pattern Recognition**

When you ask a question, the AI doesn't "think" like a person.

It predicts the most likely next word, sentence, or image based on patterns.

:::

::: right

**No Memory**

AI doesn't remember past conversations (unless in the same chat session). It responds based on what you just asked.

**Not Perfect**

AI can make mistakes, give outdated info, or "hallucinate" (make up facts that sound true but aren't).
